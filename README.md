<h2>An interpreter built using Java</h2>

This is an interpreter project built using Java for a simple custom language. The purpose is to explore and understand how interpreters and compilers work behind the scene by building a very simple interpreter.

<h4>Scanning / parsing / lexical analysis</h4>
All the tokens of the language are defined in this stage and are scanned from a source file or the command line interpreter. The Token types are defined in a Java class using an enumerated list.
